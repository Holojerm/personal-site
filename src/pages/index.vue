    <p>Welcome to my website!  I'm not a big fan of titles, but I've done software engineering for a monetary reward.  You get the idea.  On this site you can find my <a href="/projects">projects</a>, <a href="/writings">writings</a>, and a way to <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.  Take a look around, relax, and stay a while.</p>
    <h2>What I'm Up To</h2>
    <p><i>Updated 2-24-2022</i></p>
    <p>I left my job at FactSet to pursue my interests in crypto, web3, and data science.</p>
    <p><strong>Crypto</strong>: I am currently reading David Wong's <i>Real World Cryptography</i> to develop a foundational understanding of applied cryptography.</p>
    <p><strong>Web3</strong>: Planning a series of projects to develop my Solidity and Cairo skills.  I am also following Crypto Twitter as well as various Discords to find my place in the Web3 ecosystem.</p>
    <p><strong>Data Science</strong>: I am currently reading Fran√ßois Chollet's <i>Deep Learning with Python</i> to refresh my domain knowledge.  I plan on completing several Kaggle competitions and am considering participating in a Data Science bootcamp.</p>
    <p>I am developing this personal site to showcase my projects, skills, and ideas.  I welcome any and all feedback.  Thank you for reading!</p>
